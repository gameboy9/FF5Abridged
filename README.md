### Final Fantasy V:  Awesome Battles Randomized Involving Danger, Gilgamesh, and Ex Death

Welcome to my eleventh randomizer, this one from the Pixel Remaster of Final Fantasy V!  In this randomizer, I have created a REALLY Big Bridge!
12 segments, in fact, with each segment containing lots of monsters.  At the end of each segment, you will fight progressively more difficult bosses.

As with FF4: Fabul Gauntlet, this will test how well you can manage your resources as you go through each segment.

# How to play
Download both the FF5GameAssets.zip and FF5Abridged.zip files.  Extract only the latter.  Run the EXE, locate your MAIN FF5 PR folder, then click the "extract" button
to load the randomizer resources.  Then set your options, then click "Randomize" and you should be good to go.

# Other notable changes
- This is based off of Memoria.  While I have disabled the toggle key for encounters and speedups, you can change that if you really wanted to.

# Special Thanks
- mcgrew (Dragon Warrior Randomizer author) for inspiring me to create randomizers
- Albeoris - author of Memoria for the Pixel Remaster, which really helped me create this randomizer
- riversmccown and Nyobari - For the title of this randomizer!
